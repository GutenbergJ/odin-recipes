    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a great way to introduce Middle Eastern foods! The dip is creamy, delicious, and tastes great on bread, naan, or with pita! You may want to drizzle extra olive oil over the top of the finished baba ganoush.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound eggplant</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tahini</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon red chile powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon plain yogurt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Halve eggplants and brush cut sides with olive oil. Place face-down onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scoop flesh out of skins and place in a mesh strainer. Discard skins. Press down on flesh to remove liquid or drippings. Transfer eggplant flesh to a food processor. Add lemon juice, tahini, garlic, cumin, and chile powder. Drizzle olive oil on top of everything. Blend well, 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Mix in plain yogurt and season with salt. Serve with a sprinkle of paprika over top for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
